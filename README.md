# CP2K

CP2K is a quantum chemistry and solid state physics software package that can
perform atomistic simulations of solid state, liquid, molecular, periodic,
material, crystal, and biological systems. CP2K provides a general framework for
different modeling methods such as DFT using the mixed Gaussian and plane waves
approaches GPW and GAPW. Supported theory levels include DFTB, LDA, GGA, MP2,
RPA, semi-empirical methods (AM1, PM3, PM6, RM1, MNDO, ...), and classical force
fields (AMBER, CHARMM, ...). CP2K can do simulations of molecular dynamics,
metadynamics, Monte Carlo, Ehrenfest dynamics, vibrational analysis, core level
spectroscopy, energy minimization, and transition state optimization using NEB
or dimer method.

CP2K is written in Fortran 2008 and can be run efficiently in parallel using
a combination of multi-threading, MPI, and CUDA.

## Downloading CP2K source code

To clone the current master (development version):

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k.git cp2k
```

Note the `--recursive` flag that is needed because CP2K uses git submodules.

To clone a release version v*x.y*:

```shell
git clone -b support/vx.y --recursive https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k.git cp2k
```

For more information on downloading CP2K, see [Downloading CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org/download).
For help on git, see [Git Tips & Tricks](https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/wiki/Git-Tips-&-Tricks).

## Install CP2K

The easiest way to build CP2K with all of its dependencies is as a [Docker container](./tools/docker/README.md).

For building CP2K from scratch see the [installation instructions](./INSTALL.md).
